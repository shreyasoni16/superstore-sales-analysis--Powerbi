• Business Problem 
Retail businesses often struggle to understand their sales performance, profit trends, and which products or regions are driving revenue. Without clear insights, it’s difficult to make data-driven decisions, identify opportunities for growth, or improve profitability. This project addresses this problem by providing an interactive Power BI dashboard that helps businesses analyze sales, profit, regional performance, and product category trends, enabling smarter decision making.

Key questions such as: Which regions generate the highest revenue and profit? Which product categories and sub-categories perform best? Who are the top customers and segments driving sales? How are sales and profit trends evolving month-to-month or year-to-year?

• Goal of the Dashboard 
The goal of this dashboard is to provide an interactive, visual tool that helps businesses analyze Superstore sales and profit data. It enables users to identify top-performing regions, products, categories, and customer segments, track monthly and yearly sales trends, and make informed, data-driven decisions to improve revenue, profitability, and overall business performance.
